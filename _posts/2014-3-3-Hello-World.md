this is a test. if you are able to read this, this means my blog is sucessfully running on github! 
owning a blog of my own has always been one of my dreams, and thanks to modern technology and my friend tsja, this became reality!
i think i'll post a hell lotta things here and i'll figure out how to change backgroud, send newsletters and stuff.
thank you!
